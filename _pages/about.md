# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

Hi! I'm **Jiaqi Wang**. You can call me Jackie, which sounds like Jiaqi. I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology joint-programmed by the [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/) (HITSZ), and the [Pengcheng Laboratory](https://www.pcl.ac.cn/) (PCL), now working with Prof.[Zhiguo Zhang](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zgzhang) & Prof.[Zhengyu Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=21SR930AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 
I obtained my master's degree in the School of Communication Engineering at [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) (JLU), where I worked with Prof.[Wanzhong Chen](https://dce.jlu.edu.cn/info/1182/9723.htm). 
I obtained my bachelor's degree in the School of Automation at [Northeast Electric Power University](http://www.neepu.edu.cn/) (NEEPU), where I worked with Associate Prof.Xueqiang Shen.

My first-authored research has been published in conferences and journals like ACL and BSPC. I have experience in reviewing academic journals and conferences, including ACM MM, IEEE TNSRE, IEEE TIM, BSPC, and ICASSP, and I will serve as an invited reviewer for ICLR 2025.

You can find my CV here: [Jiaqi Wang's CV (CN) ](../assets/CV_zn.pdf).
